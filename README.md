imgclip
=======

An absolutely quick and dirty program to store a PNG image file and
its future URL (upload achieved with another script) in an X11
selection/clipboard.

It was created because `xclip(1)` was only capable of keeping a
selection in a single format (image OR text) and I wanted two (image
AND text).

Code heavily based on excerpts from
